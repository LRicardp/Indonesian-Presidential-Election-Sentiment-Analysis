This is my scientific paper project to study sentiment analysis towards Indonesia's presidential candidates 2024.
The dataset is collected from firdaus, asno (2023), “Indonesia Presidential Candidate's Dataset, 2024”, Mendeley Data, V5, doi: 10.17632/7w5zvr8jgp.5 .
I personally found the dataset from Kaggle [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jocelyndumlao/indonesia-presidential-candidates-dataset-2024].
The dataset consists of 30,000 tweets, already categorized according to the each candidate, and labeled as positive and negative.
If you can not see the Google Colab, you can just download the zip file named "Project".
